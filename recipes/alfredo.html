    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish.</p>
    <p>My boyfriend (women wrote the article) is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces dry fettucine pasta</li> <br>
        <li>1 cup butter</li> <br>
        <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li> <br>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li> <br>
        <li>1 dash garlic salt</li> <br>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li> <br>
        <li>1/2 gup grated Parmesan cheese</li> <br>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
