# odin-recipe
This is odin recipe project from foundations: 1 goal, finish this in less than an hour
Goal: Create a recipe web page with 3 recipes of your choice and images:
Skills: Demonstrate linking, images, basic styling skills, italicizing, and flow, as well as file organization

Will have to come back to center my texts and give a 
attractive lay out to the page, otherwise its just messed up looking.
ie in center is title
below 3 in a row recipes and respctive links
