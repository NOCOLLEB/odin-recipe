If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above), doing this is straightforward.

GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name.

A GitHub paid account is required to publish web projects from a private repository. Free accounts can only publish from public repositories.
There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

Make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
Go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the Settings button as shown in the screenshot below.Screenshot pointing to the Settings located in an example repository
Click on Pages on the left side bar.
Change the Branch from none to main branch and click Save.
It may take a few minutes (The GitHub website says up to 10, but we’ve seen it take up to an hour. Do not add a “theme” to your project, or you may have git conflicts, instead, be patient.) but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
If your project does not publish after 1 hour, ensure that you have a file called index.html in the root of your repository and all the settings have been set correctly. Go to your repo on GitHub and click on Actions, if there are no entries, then go back to the settings, change the Branch from main branch to none and click Save, then change the Branch from none to main branch and click Save.
